## 🐛 Pest & Disease Monitoring System

<div align="center">

**Developer:** WBWMRK Aluvihare  
**Role:** Pest & Disease Detection and Real-time Monitoring

</div>

### Overview
AI-powered detection system using **YOLOv8** and **ESP32-CAM** for real-time monitoring of lavender health, detecting diseases and pest infestations with automatic alerts.

### What It Does
- 📹 **Live Detection** - Continuous monitoring via ESP32-CAM (320x240 @ 10 FPS)
- 🎯 **3 Detection Classes** - Disease, Healthy plants, and Insects
- 🔔 **Automatic Alerts** - Buzzer sound + LED flash when pests detected
- 💻 **Two Modes** - Static image analysis and real-time streaming

### Technology Stack
```
Hardware: ESP32-CAM, Buzzer, LED
Software: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, NumPy
Communication: WiFi streaming (Port 81) + UDP control (Port 82)
```

### How It Works
```
ESP32-CAM → WiFi Stream → YOLOv8 Detection → Alert System → Farmer Notification
```

### Training Details
- **Model:** YOLOv8m (Medium)
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Image Size:** 960x960 (training), 320x240 (live detection)
- **Classes:** Lavender_Disease, Lavender_Healthy, Insect

### Key Features
✅ Real-time detection with 10-frame stability buffer  
✅ Confidence threshold: 0.20-0.25  
✅ Auto-reconnection on network failure  
✅ Interactive controls (adjust threshold, manual LED toggle)  
✅ Cost-effective using ESP32-CAM ($5 hardware)

### Installation
```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy

# Run detection
python Insect_live.py          # Live monitoring
python Detect_Lavender.py      # Static images
python Model_Train.py          # Train custom model
```
